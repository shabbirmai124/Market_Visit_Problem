Alice is a software engineer who loves to visit the local artisan market every weekend. One day, she goes to the market to look for unique, handcrafted items. As she walks through the stalls, she spots a beautiful hand-painted vase that would be perfect for her living room.

She spends some time admiring the vase but ultimately decides not to buy it due to its high price. However, after coming home, she starts to regret her decision. The vase had a one-of-a-kind design, and she knows it would be a great addition to her home decor. Alice decides to search for the vase online, hoping to find it on the artist's website or an e-commerce platform.

In this scenario, there are multiple factors and potential problems that need to be managed concurrently:

Alice's decision-making process.
The availability of the vase at the market and online.
The synchronization of the artist's inventory between the market and the online platform.
The competition among other potential customers who might also be interested in buying the vase.
To solve these problems, a C program can be developed using semaphores, processes, and thread mutex locks:

Semaphores can be used to manage the availability of the vase and ensure that it is not sold to multiple customers simultaneously.
Processes can represent the different actions Alice takes (e.g., visiting the market, searching online, and making a purchase) and can run concurrently.
Thread mutex locks can be used to synchronize the artist's inventory between the market and the online platform, ensuring that the vase's availability is accurately reflected on both platforms.
By using semaphores, processes, and thread mutex locks, the C program can effectively simulate Alice's experience of finding, deciding not to buy, regretting her decision, and searching for the vase online. This approach addresses the potential challenges and concurrency issues that arise in this scenario.
